<strong><i>Try to remain as calm as possible.</i></strong> Quickly, 
thoroughly search immediate area, inside and out. 
Then call police without delay; ask them to send 
an officer. <strong><i>There is never a waiting period for 
filing a missing person report on a child.</i></strong> After 
calling the police, <strong><i>stay by the phone</i></strong> for messages; 
let others continue the search.
</li>
<br>
<li>
If at a store or mall, contact manager of security; 
ask them to search. Then <strong><i>call police!</i></strong>
</li>
<br>
<li>
<strong><i>During the next few hours</i></strong>, stay where you are 
or take a cell phone with you so you can be contacted. 
Organize people to help in the search. If away from 
home, have someone bring your child's photos; arrange 
for someone to take calls at home.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Register with Missing Children Minnesota, 612-334-9449 or 
1-888-RUN-YELL (or a child search agency near you), as soon 
as you can. We can help with logistics, provide "missing child" 
posters, guidance, advocacy, emotional support, etc.

<br>
<li>
If your child uses a computer, "freeze" it until you can 
check child's e-mail and previous online activities. Check 
child's cellphone call records.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Make sure there's an answering machine or voicemail on your phone. 
<strong><i>At the very beginning of the message</i></strong> say, "We will accept long 
distance collect calls." That way, if your child (or someone with 
information about your child) calls you collect, the operator 
will let them leave a message.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Over the next few days, stay in touch with police and MCM; make 10 
or more copies of your child's best, most recent photo; <strong><i>take notes 
on everything</i></strong>; mnake sure phone is covered; call 1-800-THE-LOST 
and register your child.

<p>
In addition to putting together I.D. folders (see Child 
I.D. Kit Check List) for your child(ren), establish a plan 
for your family in case you become separated at a store 
or at an event away from home. Teach your children (and 
periodically review with them) how to respond to a 
threatening situation. Request MCM's brochure,
