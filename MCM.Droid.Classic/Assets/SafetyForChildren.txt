<li>
Teach your child his/her name, address, phone number (including the area code). Teach 
your children how to <strong><i>use the phone</i></strong>, including how to make a 
long-distance collect call to <strong><i>YOU</i></strong>. Teach your children how to dial 
911 when there's an emergency.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Young children should <strong><i>never</i></strong> be <strong><i>left unattended in a car</i></strong>; 
they <strong><i>should not </i></strong>be outside playing by themselves, or anywhere else 
<strong><i>without supervision</i></strong>. Children who are old enough to be left alone still need to 
have an adult resource to check in with (by phone, if necessary) and to talk to if they have questions 
or need help in case of an emergency (<strong><i>after</i></strong> calling 911).
</li>
<br>
<li>
Teach preschool-age children to <strong><i>never TAKE</i></strong> anything from anyone without 
your approval. Teach them to say, "I have to ask first!" and <strong><i>run right away</i></strong> 
to you or the person who's taking care of them, <strong><i>tell what happened</i></strong> and ask for 
permission.
</li>

<li>
Teach preschool-age children to <strong><i>never GO</i></strong> anywhere with anyone or 
<strong><i>GET INTO A CAR</i></strong> with anyone without your approval. Teach them to say, 
"I have to ask first!" and <strong><i>run right away</i></strong> to you or the person who's 
taking care of them, <strong><i>tell what happened</i></strong> and ask for 
permission.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Teach school-age children about the <strong><i>lures</i></strong> child molesters use: "I've lost my 
puppy. Can you help me find him?" <strong><i>or</i></strong> "Let's go get some ice cream!" 
<strong><i>or</i></strong> "Hurry! Come with me! Your mom's been hurt!" etc.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Teach your children it's okay to say "<strong></i>no</i></strong>" to grown-ups, especially where 
their bodies are concerned. They don't have to hug or kiss anyone they don't want to. It may be 
inconvenient for you, but it could save your child.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Tell your children that if they're feeling threatened they should <strong><i>RUN</i></strong> to where 
there are people, <strong><i>YELL</i></strong> for help and <strong><i>TELL</i></strong> an adult what 
happened to them.
